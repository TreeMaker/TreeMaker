```

Several predefined scenarios are available for ease of production.
These scenarios define various sample-dependent parameters, including:  
global tag, collection tag name, generator info, fastsim, signal, JSON file, JEC file, residual JECs, era.  
The available scenarios are:  
1. `Spring16Fastsig`: for Spring16 miniAOD 25ns FastSim MC (signal scans)  
2. `Spring16Pmssm`: for Spring16 miniAOD 25ns PMSSM MC scan (signal)  
3. `Summer16`: for Summer16 miniAOD 25ns MC  
4. `Summer16sig`: for Summer16 miniAOD 25ns MC (signal)  
5. `2016H`: for 2016H PromptReco 25ns data  
6. `2016ReReco23Sep`: for 2016 ReReco (23Sep) 25ns data, periods B-G  
7. `2016ReMiniAOD03Feb`: for 2016 ReMiniAOD (03Feb) 25ns data, periods B-H

## Unit Tests (Interactive Runs)

Several predefined run commands (at least one for each scenario) are defined in a script called [unitTest.py](./Production/test/unitTest.py). It has several parameters:
* `test`: number of the test to run (default=-1, displays all tests)
* `name`: name of the output ROOT and log files for the test (default="", each test has its own default name)
* `run`: run the selected test (default=False)
* `numevents`: how many events to run (default=100)
* `shell`: how to format the command (default="tcsh", also knows "bash")

A few examples of how to run the script:  
1) To see all tests:
```
python unitTest.py
```
2) To run test 2:
```
python unitTest.py test=2 run=True
```

Note that all of the background estimation processes (and some processes necessary to estimate systematic uncertainties) are turned *ON* by default in [runMakeTreeFromMiniAOD_cfg.py](./Production/test/runMakeTreeFromMiniAOD_cfg.py).

## Submit Production to Condor

Condor submission on the LPC batch system is supported. Support for submission to the global pool via [CMS Connect](https://connect.uscms.org/) is preliminary.
The scripts in this section use the [Condor Python bindings](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/current/6_7Python_Bindings.html), which require `/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages` to be in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.
For full functionality, the Python packages `paramiko` and `python-gssapi` are also required.

To reduce the size of the CMSSW tarball sent to the Condor worker node, there are a few standard directories that can be marked as cached using the script [cache_all.sh](./Production/test/cache_all.sh):
```
./cache_all.sh
```

The [test/condorSub](./Production/test/condorSub/) directory contains all of the relevant scripts.
If you copy this to another directory and run the [looper.py](./Production/test/condorSub/looper.py) script, it will submit one job per file to condor for all of the relevant samples. Example:
```
cp -r condorSub myProduction
cd myProduction
python looper.py -o root://cmseos.fnal.gov//store/user/YOURUSERNAME/myProduction -s
```
Consult the `--help` option to view the available options.
[looper.py](./Production/test/condorSub/looper.py) can also check for jobs which were completely removed from the queue and make a resubmission list.

The jobs open the files over xrootd, so [looper.py](./Production/test/condorSub/looper.py) will check that you have a valid grid proxy. 
It will also make a tarball of the current CMSSW working directory to send to the worker node. 
If you want to reuse an existing CMSSW tarball (no important changes have been made since the last time you submitted jobs), add the argument `-k`.

When the python file list for a given sample (usually data) is updated, it may be desirable to submit jobs only for the new files.
The input dictionary format for [looper.py](./Production/test/condorSub/looper.py) optionally allows a (non-zero) starting number to be placed after the sample name.
To get the number of the first new job, just use `len(readFiles)` from the python file list *before* updating it.

When submitting jobs for prompt data, each data file will be checked to see if the run it contains is certified in the corresponding JSON file. The JSON file is taken by default from the scenario; an alternative can be specified with the `--json` option, e.g. if the JSON is updated and you want to submit jobs only for the newly certified runs. (Use [compareJSON.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_7_6_X/FWCore/PythonUtilities/scripts/compareJSON.py) to subtract one JSON list from another, following [this twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideGoodLumiSectionsJSONFile#How_to_compare_Good_Luminosity_f).)

Sometimes, a few jobs might fail, e.g. due to xrootd connectivity problems.
Failed jobs are placed in "held" status in the Condor queue.
This enables the job output and parameters to be examined.
The job can be examined and resubmitted using the script [manageJobs.py](./Production/test/condorSub/manageJobs.py).
Consult the `--help` option for the script to view the available functions.

## Calculate Integrated Luminosity

Scripts are available to calculate the integrated luminosity from data ntuples (produced with TreeMaker):
```
python lumiSummary.py
python calcLumi.py
```

The script [lumiSummary.py](./Production/test/lumiSummary.py) loops over a list of data samples (by default, a list of Run2015C and Run2015D samples) and creates a JSON
file for each sample consisting of the lumisections which were actually processed. Run `python lumiSummary.py --help` to see the available options.
(This script is based on the CRAB3 client job report scripts.)

The resulting JSON file can be run through [brilcalc](http://cms-service-lumi.web.cern.ch/cms-service-lumi/brilwsdoc.html) using [calcLumi.py](./Production/test/calcLumi.py)
to determine the integrated luminosity for the dataset. Run `python calcLumi.py --help` to see the available options. (NB: this only works on lxplus with brilcalc installed.)

## Calculate Pileup Corrections

A script is available to calculate the pileup corrections for MC:
```
python pileupCorr.py
```

A ROOT file containing the data, MC, and data/MC histograms (with uncertainty variations) is produced. Run `python pileupCorr.py --help` to see the available options.

## Info for New Samples

The script [get_mcm.py](./Production/test/get_mcm.py) can search the McM database for given samples (with wildcard support) to discern the status of the sample (whether it has finished running), the generator cross section, and the full dataset path for the sample ("/X/Y/Z" format).
Command line options exist to specify campaign names and other information, which can be viewed with the `--help` option.
An example dictionary of samples and extensions to check can be found at [dict_mcm.py](./Production/test/dict_mcm.py).
This script can only be run on lxplus due to the need for [cern-get-sso-cookie](http://linux.web.cern.ch/linux/docs/cernssocookie.shtml) to access the McM database.

The script [get_py.py](./Production/test/get_py.py) will automatically create the "_cff.py" python file containing the list of ROOT files for samples specified in a Python ordered dictionary, e.g. [dict.py](./Production/test/dict.py) (enabled with `-p`).
For MC samples, it can also automatically generate the appropriate configuration line to add the sample to [getWeightProducer_cff.py](./WeightProducer/python/getWeightProducer_cff.py), if the cross section is specified (enabled with `-w`).
The script can also check to see which sites (if any) have 100% dataset presence for the sample (enabled with `-s`).
(You may also need `export SSL_CERT_DIR='/etc/pki/tls/certs:/etc/grid-security/certificates'` (bash) or `setenv SSL_CERT_DIR '/etc/pki/tls/certs:/etc/grid-security/certificates'` (tcsh) to avoid the error `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` from `urllib2`.)

Before running the script for the first time, some environment settings are necessary:
```
source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/crab3/crab.csh
```

To run the script:
```
python get_py.py -d dict.py [options]
```

To check for new samples, use the above script [get_mcm.py](./Production/test/get_mcm.py) or query DAS, e.g.:
```
das_client.py --query="dataset=/*/RunIISpring16MiniAOD*/MINIAODSIM" --limit=0 | & less
```

### Samples with Negative Weight Events

Samples produced at NLO by amcatnlo have events with negative weights, which must be handled correctly. To get the effective number of events used to weight the sample, there is a multi-step process.

Step 1: Get the "_cff.py" files, without generating WeightProducer lines (assuming samples are listed in `dictNLO.py`).
```
python get_py.py dict=dictNLO.py wp=False
```

Step 2: Run NeffFinder, a simple analyzer which calculates the effective number of events for a sample.
The analyzer should be submitted as a Condor batch job for each sample (assuming samples are listed in [looperNeff.sh](./Production/test/condorSubNeff/looperNeff.sh)), because the xrootd I/O bottleneck is prohibitive when running interactively.
Be sure to sanity-check the results, as xrootd failures can cause jobs to terminate early.
```
cp -r condorSubNeff myNeff
cd myNeff
./looperNeff.sh
(after jobs are finished)
python getResults.py
```

Step 3: Update `dictNLO.py` with the newly-obtained Neff values and generate WeightProducer lines.
```
python get_py.py dict=dictNLO.py py=False
```
